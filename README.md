# Commute Insights for San Joaquin County

This repository contains the capstone project: **"Understanding Commuter Patterns and Emissions in San Joaquin County"**, developed using datasets from UrbanFootprint, Replica, and StreetLight. The goal was to analyze travel behavior, identify transportation inefficiencies, and propose equity-focused recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and vehicle miles traveled (VMT).

## 📊 Project Overview

San Joaquin County is facing challenges in balancing sustainable transportation planning with regional growth. Our project analyzes intra-county, inbound, and outbound travel patterns to provide actionable insights. Using data-driven methods, we assess:

- Travel mode share (private car, bike, transit, walk)
- Commute distances and time of day
- Transportation equity gaps
- GHG emissions by zip code and vehicle type

## 📁 Project Structure

- `SJCOG_Urban footprint.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for zone-level analysis from UrbanFootprint
- `Capstone_Project_Report.pdf`: Full written report including findings, maps, and policy recommendations
- `Customer Churn Analysis...ipynb`: (Legacy notebook not directly related to this project)

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Private vehicles dominate travel across all trip types
- Certain zones show high emissions due to long distances or lack of alternatives
- Walking/biking are underused due to infrastructure gaps
- Equity concerns exist where underserved communities lack access to transit

## 🌿 Recommendations

- Expand active transportation infrastructure (protected bike lanes, sidewalks)
- Implement TOD (Transit-Oriented Development) near high-emission zones
- Invest in electrification and affordable EV programs
- Align land use planning with transportation demand

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
- UrbanFootprint, Replica, and StreetLight data
- Adobe Illustrator (for map design and visuals)

## 📍 Data Sources

- UrbanFootprint: Zone-level land use and demographics
- Replica: Trip-level commute data
- StreetLight: Transportation behavior and VMT data
